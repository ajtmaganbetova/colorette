## Color Palette Explorer

Color Palette Explorer is a web application that allows users to explore, customize, and create color palettes. This project has laid a solid foundation, and I aim to build upon it to expand the project further. 

## Features

Color Selection: Users can select individual colors from the color picker palette and select up to 10 colors.
Customization: Users can adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness of each selected color.
Palette Management: Users can save their created color palettes and share them with others.

## How to run
To run the Color Palette Explorer locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Or you can find a GitHub Pages link under the description.

## Further development
The user interface may not be fully optimized and accessible for smaller screen sizes and mobile devices, leading to a suboptimal user experience on such devices. As I continue to work on it, I'll address various aspects and enhance its functionality, namely, discovering palettes, improving responsiveness and implementing user accounts.
